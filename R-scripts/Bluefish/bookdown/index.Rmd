# Introduction

These are preliminary regressions that compare bluefish catch, abundance, recruitment, and F to various indicators taken from the `ecodata` package. The indicators are lagged by `r params$lag` years.

# Regression analysis

All regressions are simple linear correlations assessed at the p < 0.5 level. Please note, due to the large number of indicators tested, a certain amount of statistically significant results are expected even if there are no underlying mechanistic connections. These correlations do not necessarily imply causation.
