<p>Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines. Fall has solid trend lines, and spring has dashed trend lines. Please note, sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.</p>

<p>Ricky Tabandera</p>
<p>Diversity in age measurements of a stock is a useful indicator of several factors relating to fishing pressure and recruitment. A decrease in diversity can be due to either truncation, the lack of older or younger ages. Diversity changes as a function of an increase of a single/few ages relative to the usual stock age structure or as more ages become less represented. Diagnostic plots of age are constructed below using fisheries independent data from <code>survdat</code>.</p>
