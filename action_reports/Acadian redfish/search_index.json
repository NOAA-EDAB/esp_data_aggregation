This report is pulling information on all Northeast Acadian redfish stocks. "],["methods.html", "1 Methods 1.1 Stock identification 1.2 Data collection and presentation 1.3 Risk assessment", " 1 Methods 1.1 Stock identification Northeast stocks were identified from NOAA/EDAB ECSA seasonal species strata. 1.2 Data collection and presentation Data sources for each analysis are identified in the Results. All continuous temporal data were plotted against time. If there were 30 or more years of data, a geom_gls regression line was fit (yellow = significant increase; purple = significant decrease; no line = no significant trend). If there were fewer than 30 years of data, no regression was fit. 1.2.1 assessmentdata methods Stock assessment and data quality information were compiled into a summary table. B/Bmsy was classified as DANGER if it was below 1 and GOOD if it was above 1. F/Fmsy was classified as DANGER if it was above 1 and GOOD if it was below 1. 1.2.2 survdat methods survdat data with zero abundance were not included in this analysis. Abundance and biomass were summed for each year and season. All other metrics were averaged for each year and season. The tables show summary statistics for the entire time series and for the most recent 5 years in the time series. 1.3 Risk assessment 1.3.1 Risk across stocks 1.3.1.1 Suite of indicators All stocks were ranked in order of increasing risk. The stock with the highest ranking is the stock determined to be at the highest risk. In this case, high risk has two meanings: (1) high importance (e.g., a stock with a high catch would have a high risk ranking for the catch indicator) or high vulnerability (e.g., a stock with low B/Bmsy would have a high risk ranking for the B/Bmsy indicator). The normalized rank was determined by dividing each stocks rank by the total number of stocks considered for that indicator. Stocks that were missing indicator measurements were assigned a normalized rank of 0.5. 1.3.1.2 Individual indicators Risk was calculated over time for all indicators that were documented for five or more species in a given year. Risk was calculated as the average of the past 5 years, as a percent of the historical average. The normalized risk value was calculated as the normalized rank of this species compared to all other species in that year. 1.3.2 Risk within stocks The normalized risk value was calculated as the normalized rank of each yearly measurement compared to all other years.

Figure 2.1: Acadian redfish distribution 2.1.2 Latitude and longitude ranges Latitude and longitude ranges were calculated from NOAA/EDAB ECSA seasonal species strata and Bottom Trawl Survey (BTS) shapefiles. The coordinate system is WGS84. 2.2 Geographic distribution Ricky Tabandera Using fisheries independant data from bottom trawls in survdat. Several metrics of distribution in observed catches are calculated. Changes in distributuion can indicate changes in the geographic range of a species due to a variety of constraints such as food availability or physiologic limitations.The unweighted centroid is one metric that describes the geometric center of the observed range of Acadian redfish in a given year. Calculated as the mean of latitude and longitude of all tows that captured the species of interest.The density of observations for Acadian redfish was visualized using two-dimensional kernel density estimation on a grid as documented in MASS::kde2d. This density estimation is then visualized to indicate areas of greater or lesser probability of occurrence 2.2.1 Figures 2.2.1.1 Density and distribution estimation by season 2.2.1.2 Centroid of observations The average position of observations across all years of surveys ## [1] &quot;Not enough data&quot; 2.3 Temperature Surface and bottom temperature data were pulled from survdat. 2.3.1 Figures Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.

Thus, observed depth can signal changes in habitat suitability. Changes in this metric can indicate the required resources are changing their distribution on the landscape. Seasonal differences in occurrence can also help identify essential habitat and the timing of migration to acquire seasonal resources 2.5.1 Figures 2.6 Habitat vulnerability Habitat vulnerability information is sourced from the ecodata package. ## [1] &quot;NO DATA&quot; "],["biological-information.html", "3 Biological information 3.1 Length 3.2 von Bertalanffy growth curve 3.3 Length at first maturity 3.4 Condition 3.5 Diet", " 3 Biological information 3.1 Length Length data were pulled from survdat.

Growth parameters of Linf (Length infinty), K (growth coefficient), and t0 (size at time 0) were estimated using non-linear least square model. The starting point for model building is accomplished using FSA::vbStarts. Age and length data sourced from survdat and spans all years and survey areas. 3.3 Length at first maturity Ricky Tabandera 3.3.1 Size at first maturity L50 or length at which 50% maturity can be calculated using differing methods. Using Data sourced from survdat that consist of visual sexual maturity determination and length measurements. Here, L50 is estimated by fitting a logistic generalized linear model to gonadal maturity and body length measurements and estimating the inflection point of the logistic model. This point represents the size where the individual has 50% odds of being mature. Decade variations of this parameter are investigated utilizing decade as a additive and interaction term in the model specification. The relationship between sexual maturity by body size is a well established life history parameter. L50 is a useful metric in fisheries to identify sizes that are able to reproduce. This information can be used to inform regulation as to minimum catch size that should allow for a significant portion of the population to spawn and contribute genetic information to sustain the stock. Changes in this parameter can signal population/evolutionary pressures on the stock with reduction in this size potentially indicating excessive fishing pressure. 3.3.2 Maturity classification The gonadal development stage can vary between immature and mature. Once mature, there are several stages that represent phases in the spawning sequence. These stages and phases can vary across body length and the proportion of the population in each of these categories can help identify spawning size and what seasonal effects there are on development. 3.3.3 Model results If the overall model is significant, there is support for the relationship between sexual maturity and body size. This model can predict the size where there are 50% odds of the indevidual is sexually mature. The results table below displays the L50 for Male and female indeviduals.

We calculated a rough condition factor as: Weight / Length^3, and relative weight was previously calculated. 3.4.1 Length vs weight Please note, no trend lines were fit, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area. Figure 3.12: Acadian redfish length vs weight 3.4.2 Condition factor: Weight-volume If there were more than 30 years of data, a geom_gls() regression was fit. In order to fit the geom_gls() regression, we calculated the mean condition factor for each year and plotted the geom_gls() through those points. Please note, points are jittered to reduce overlap, and sometimes the survey observed a small number of fish outside of the defined stock area.

For analysis, all geographic samples were grouped by season, year, and region, and only year-season-region combinations with more than 20 predators sampled were considered. Prey items that made up more than 5% of the predators diet in at least one year-season-region were identified to the broad category level; all other prey are grouped into the other category. 3.5.1 Figure Figure 3.15: Acadian redfish diet composition 3.5.2 Summary 3.5.3 Data "],["population-information.html", "4 Population information 4.1 Abundance 4.2 Biomass 4.3 B/Bmsy 4.4 Recruitment 4.5 Age diversity 4.6 Climate vulnerability", " 4 Population information 4.1 Abundance Abundance data were pulled from survdat and assessmentdata::stockAssessmentData. 4.1.1 Survey abundance (raw measurements) Separate geom_gls() functions were fit for fall and spring measurements; trend lines are only shown when the trend was statistically significant, so some plots may have fewer than two trend lines.

A decrease in diversity can be due to either truncation, the lack of older or younger ages. Diversity changes as a function of an increase of a single/few ages relative to the usual stock age structure or as more ages become less represented. Diagnostic plots of age are constructed below using fisheries independent data from survdat. 4.5.1 Figures Age diversity Density plots of age Age distribution across years of survey data of Acadian redfish. These plots can help identify strong year classes of recruits and how these classes persist in the fishery. 4.6 Climate vulnerability Climate vulnerability is sourced from Hare et al. (2016).
